## Work Experience
**Team Member @ Crime and Attitudes Project (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - Present_)** <br />
<sub>This project seeks to create data visualization of crime pre and post covid in connection with local attitudes on crime for the top 10-15 major U.S. cities.</sub>
- Collect and format public data files
- Perform data wrangling and cleaning in RStudio
- Utilized SHP files and managed substantial datasets

**Lab Data Analyst @ Putonti Lab (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - Present_)**
- Analyze ANI and Mash data in RStudio
- Create data visualization to convey complex insights
- Communicate cross-departmentally to facilitate research and convey findings

**Statistical Research @ Summer Research Program (Loyola Chicago) (_May 2023 - June 2023_)**  
<sub>Working with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee, I researched Zero-Inflated Poisson Distributions and related model validation techniques</sub>
- Conducted an in-depth review of existing literature pertaining to Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions and modeling
- Constructed and validated ZIP models in RStudio
- Built and executed code pipelines in R to assess differences in K-Fold Cross Validation techniques for evaluating ZIP models
- Presented findings at an end-of-program event

## Projects
### Zero-Inflated Poisson Model Validation Method Comparison
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/ZeroInflatedPoissonValidation)

There is very little literature regarding creation and validation of zero-inflated poisson models using R. In light of this, I worked with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee (Loyola University Chicago head of Data Science Program) to begin an exploration of the topic. This project contains a coding pipeline I created to compare k-fold Cross Validation with stratified k-fold CV of ZIP models.


### Amazon Prime Coursework Project

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
