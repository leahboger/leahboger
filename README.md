## Work Experience
**Data Science Intern @ The American Medical Association (Loyola Chicago) (_Dec 2023 - August 2024_)** <br />
- Use SAS, SQL, Python and Informatica Data Quality to identify and rectify over 200,000 data quality issues in physician data to maintain high accuracy for customers
- Create interactive dashboards with Power BI to give direction and oversight in order to efficiently allocate data steward resources
- Design, build, and test new process involving Informatica IDQ and Oracle to automate an existing data quality process

**Team Member @ Crime and Attitudes Project (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - May 2024_)** <br />
<sub>This project seeks to create data visualization of crime pre and post covid in connection with local attitudes on crime for the top 10-15 major U.S. cities.</sub>
- Collect and format public data files
- Perform data wrangling and cleaning in RStudio
- Utilized SHP files and managed substantial datasets

**Lab Data Analyst @ Putonti Lab (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - Jan 2024_)**
- Analyze ANI and Mash data in RStudio
- Create data visualization to convey complex insights
- Communicate cross-departmentally to facilitate research and convey findings

**Statistical Research @ Summer Research Program (Loyola Chicago) (_May 2023 - June 2023_)**  
<sub>Working with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee, I researched Zero-Inflated Poisson Distributions and related model validation techniques</sub>
- Conducted an in-depth review of existing literature pertaining to Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions and modeling
- Constructed and validated ZIP models in RStudio
- Built and executed code pipelines in R to assess differences in K-Fold Cross Validation techniques for evaluating ZIP models
- Presented findings at an end-of-program event

## Publications
### [Evidence of Lactobacillus strains shared between the female urinary and vaginal microbiota](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.001267)

At the Putonti lab at Loyola Univeristy Chicago, I worked closely with both a group of students and Dr. Swarnali Banerjee to create a statistical methodology to differentiate between strains of Lactobacillus. We were able to conduct simulations of genome assemblies and ANI comparisons and present a statistical method to distinguish between unrelated, related, and identical strains.

## Projects
### Zero-Inflated Poisson Model Validation Method Comparison
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/ZeroInflatedPoissonValidation)

There is very little literature regarding creation and validation of zero-inflated poisson models using R. In light of this, I worked with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee (Loyola University Chicago head of Data Science Program) to begin an exploration of the topic. This project contains a coding pipeline I created to compare k-fold Cross Validation with stratified k-fold CV of ZIP models.

### Data Fest 2023 Project
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/DataFest2023)

For Data Fest 2023, the American Bar Association shared data from an online portal where low-income status participants can get pro bono legal services. We sought to better understand which counties had the longest average time from question to answer on the portal. In addition, we wanted to understand how number of questions asked, as well as average response time, corresponded to a heat map of poverty in the US to inform the ABA of future areas of outreach and where to allocate resources.


### Amazon Prime Coursework Project
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/AmazonPrime)

A final project for a Data Science 101 course at Loyola University Chicago. As a big movie lover, I opted to take a look at some trends and notable achievements from an Amazon Prime data set using data visualization and data wrangling.
