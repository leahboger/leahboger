- Analyze ANI and Mash data in RStudio
- Create data visualization to convey complex insights
- Communicate cross-departmentally to facilitate research and convey findings

**Statistical Research @ Summer Research Program (Loyola Chicago) (_May 2023 - June 2023_)**  
<sub>Working with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee, I researched Zero-Inflated Poisson Distributions and related model validation techniques</sub>
- Conducted an in-depth review of existing literature pertaining to Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions and modeling
- Constructed and validated ZIP models in RStudio
- Built and executed code pipelines in R to assess differences in K-Fold Cross Validation techniques for evaluating ZIP models
- Presented findings at an end-of-program event

## Projects
### Zero-Inflated Poisson Model Validation Method Comparison
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
