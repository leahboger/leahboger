- B.S., Data Science | Loyola University Chicago (_Anticipated: May 2025_)

## Work Experience
**Team Member @ Crime and Attitudes Project (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - Present_)** <br />
<sub>This project seeks to create data visualization of crime pre and post covid in connection with local attitudes on crime for the top 10-15 major U.S. cities.</sub>
- Collect and format public data files
- Perform data wrangling and cleaning in RStudio
- Utilized SHP files and managed substantial datasets

**Lab Data Analyst @ Putonti Lab (Loyola Chicago) (_Sept 2023 - Present_)**
- Analyze ANI and Mash data in RStudio
- Create data visualization to convey complex insights
- Communicate cross-departmentally to facilitate research and convey findings

**Statistical Research @ Summer Research Program (Loyola Chicago) (_May 2023 - June 2023_)**  
<sub>Working with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee, I researched Zero-Inflated Poisson Distributions and related model validation techniques</sub>
- Conducted an in-depth review of existing literature pertaining to Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distributions and modeling
- Constructed and validated ZIP models in RStudio
- Built and executed code pipelines in R to assess differences in K-Fold Cross Validation techniques for evaluating ZIP models
- Presented findings at an end-of-program event

## Projects
### Zero-Inflated Poisson Model Validation Method Comparison
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/ZeroInflatedPoissonValidation)

There is very little literature regarding creation and validation of zero-inflated poisson models using R. In light of this, I worked with Dr. Swarnali Banerjee (Loyola University Chicago head of Data Science Program) to begin an exploration of the topic. This project contains a coding pipeline I created to compare k-fold Cross Validation with stratified k-fold CV of ZIP models.

### Data Fest 2023 Project
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/DataFest2023)

For Data Fest 2023, the American Bar Association shared data from an online portal where low-income status participants can get pro bono legal services. We sought to better understand which counties had the longest average time from question to answer on the portal. In addition, we wanted to understand how number of questions asked, as well as average response time, corresponded to a heat map of poverty in the US to inform the ABA of future areas of outreach and where to allocate resources.


### Amazon Prime Coursework Project
[Project Repository](https://github.com/leahboger/AmazonPrime)

A final project for a Data Science 101 course at Loyola University Chicago. As a big movie lover, I opted to take a look at some trends and notable achievements from an Amazon Prime data set using data visualization and data wrangling.
